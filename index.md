Kinshasa Taxis provides a unique pre-bookable meet and greet airport taxi service for all travellers arriving at Kinshasa Airport who are not being met by friends or business acquaintances. There is no taxi rank at the airport.

It is unique as all other transfer services at the airport are by shuttle bus. Such buses can add considerably to journey times as drop-offs are made throughout the Kinshasa centre and suburbs.

Kinshasa Taxis offers the capability to book directly with an office in the UK via text, phone or email.

The cost of a transfer for up to 2 passengers from the airport to anywhere in Kinshasa, or its immediate surroundings, is US$50
