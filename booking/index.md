Please include details of your name, flight details and the number of people to be met or sufficient information for us to be able to contact you within 24 hours.

To avoid any potential misunderstanding we prefer only to take telephone bookings using English. If you wish to conduct your booking in any other language please text or email.

Book as early as possible by whatever method suits you best. We will then contact the drivers to arrange for them to meet you.

Meeting arrangements at the airport vary almost daily commensurate with the level of security in force. Approximately 48 hours before your arrival, or upon booking if you are booking within 2 days of arrival, we will advise you of the level of the then current security and how to meet the driver.

We will also advise at that time which driver will meet you and his local telephone number so that you can contact him whilst you are in the baggage hall area.

No booking fee is payable. You pay the driver US$50 directly upon completion of your journey.

Occasionally, Eden and Jean may be unavailable. If so, they will arrange for an alternative driver to meet you. We will notify you of this so that you can make your own decision as to whether you wish to proceed with the alternative driver.
